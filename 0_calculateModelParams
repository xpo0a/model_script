### if you only have model parames not include model.
import torch

PATH = 'your own path'  # only model dict

model = torch.load(PATH)
sum = 0
for i in model['params']:
  sum += model['params'][i].numel()

print(sum/1e6)  # M

### if you can import model and inference it
'''
you can use *torch-summary, torchstat, thop, torchstat*
I encounter a question.
def forward(x, weight): # in FMEBN
  pass
